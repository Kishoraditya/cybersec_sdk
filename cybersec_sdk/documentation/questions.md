# Questions matrix

- **General threat**

- "What are the most critical vulnerabilities in the system? Which processes pose the highest risk?"

- **General system**

- "what can you tell about the system? What is the primary purpose of the system? What are the key components of the system architecture? How does the system integrate with existing security infrastructure? What types of threats is the system designed to detect and mitigate? How does the system balance autonomy with human oversight? What types of data does the system collect? How is data collected from end-user devices and network infrastructure? What measures are in place to ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations? How is real-time data streaming and processing implemented? What data preprocessing techniques are employed?"

- **Network Topology and Architecture**

- "What is the overall structure of the network I'm monitoring? How many endpoints, servers, and network devices are present? What are the primary communication patterns between different network segments? Are there any isolated or heavily secured network areas? What types of remote access methods are in use?"

- **Data Flow Analysis**

- "What are the main data flows within the system? Are there any unexpected data transfers or communications? What protocols are predominantly used for internal and external communications? Are there any anomalies in data volume or frequency compared to baseline? Can I identify critical data paths that require extra monitoring?"

- **User Behavior Patterns**

- "What are the typical user activity patterns in different parts of the system? Are there users exhibiting behavior significantly different from their peers? Can I detect any potential insider threats based on unusual access patterns? What are the normal working hours, and are there justified reasons for off-hours access? Are there any sudden changes in individual user behavior that warrant investigation?"

- **System Performance Metrics**

- "What are the baseline performance metrics for various system components? Are there any nodes consistently operating outside normal performance parameters? Can I correlate any performance anomalies with potential security issues? Are there any periodic patterns in system load or resource usage? How do system performance metrics change during known maintenance or update periods?"

- **Application and Service Analysis**

- "What applications and services are running on the network? Are there any unauthorized or unexpected applications in use? What are the communication patterns of critical applications? Are all services and applications up-to-date with the latest security patches? Can I detect any applications exhibiting behavior consistent with malware?"

- **Authentication and Access Patterns**

- "What are the normal authentication patterns across the system? Are there any accounts showing multiple failed login attempts? Can I detect any unusual privilege escalation activities? Are there any unauthorized attempts to access restricted resources? What are the typical access patterns for different user roles, and are there deviations?"

- **External Communication Analysis**

- "What are the normal patterns of communication with external networks? Are there any connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains? Can I detect any data exfiltration attempts? Are there any unusual spikes in outbound traffic? What are the typical destinations for outbound traffic, and are there any new ones?

- **Vulnerability Assessment**

- "What known vulnerabilities exist in the system based on current configurations? Are there any critical vulnerabilities that require immediate attention? Can I correlate existing vulnerabilities with potential exploit attempts? What is the patch status across different system components? Are there any deprecated or end-of-life software versions still in use?"

- **Anomaly Detection**

- "What types of anomalies am I detecting most frequently? Are there patterns in the anomalies that suggest coordinated attacks? How do detected anomalies correlate with known threat intelligence? Are there any persistent low-level anomalies that might indicate long-term compromise? What is the false positive rate for different types of anomalies?"

- **Incident Response Efficacy**

- "How quickly are detected threats being addressed? What is the success rate of automated response actions? Are there recurring incidents that suggest ineffective mitigation strategies? How do incident response times vary across different types of threats? Are there any gaps in the current incident response procedures?"

- **System Updates and Changes**

- "What recent system changes or updates have occurred? How have these changes affected overall system behavior and security posture? Are there any unauthorized or unexpected system modifications? How do planned maintenance activities impact security metrics? Can I detect any attempts to alter system configurations maliciously?

- **Data Encryption and Protection**

- "What percentage of network traffic is encrypted? Are there any instances of sensitive data being transmitted unencrypted? Can I detect any attempts to bypass encryption mechanisms? Are encryption keys being managed and rotated according to best practices? Are there any weak encryption protocols still in use within the system?"

- **Compliance and Policy Adherence**

- "Are there any activities that violate established security policies? Can I detect any potential compliance issues based on data handling practices? Are there users or processes attempting to circumvent security controls? How effectively are data retention policies being enforced? Are there any unauthorized changes to critical system configurations?"

- **Threat Intelligence Integration**

- "How do observed patterns correlate with known threat indicators? Are there any emerging threats that the system might be vulnerable to? Can I detect any activities matching recent threat intelligence reports?Are there any geographic or sector-specific threats relevant to this system? How rapidly is new threat intelligence being incorporated into detection mechanisms?"
