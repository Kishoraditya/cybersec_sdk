# **Challenge**

Develop an AI-driven solution that can autonomously detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity threats in real time at end user level.

The solution should leverage machine learning models to detect unusual patterns and anomalies in network traffic, user behavior, or system logs that could lead to a cyber-security incident. The solution should be capable of processing vast amounts of data, identifying unusual patterns or anomalies indicative of potential security breaches, and automating response actions to mitigate threats before they cause significant damage. It should employ advanced machine learning techniques to distinguish between normal and suspicious activities, provide clear explanations for its decisions to maintain transparency and trust, and integrate seamlessly with existing security infrastructures like SIEM systems and firewalls.
